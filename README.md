# Predict if a Person Would Have Survived the Titanic

key concept: data manipulation, data visualization, machine learning on tabular data

train.csv contains information about passengers aboard the titanic and whether they survived or not
test.csv contains information about passsengers which we're trying to predict their outcome
main.ipynb analyzes the data in train.csv, encodes and feature engineers it. The data is then used to train a machine learning model which makes a prediction on the test.csv passengers.

The final machine learning model is gradient boosting which had 76% accuracy score on the test data (submitted to a kaggle contest)
